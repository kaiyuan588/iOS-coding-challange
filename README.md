I was using XML(RSS) link for this project, but in this particular XML, there is no image link or image data, so I cannot get images from this link. I can fix this by parsing JSON file, cause in the JSON file it has image data. Let me know what do you think at first and I can always fix this, as well as adding addtional media type when I have time in the future.
